My mappings of the Kinesis Advantage 2 Keyboard
===============================================

I am a computer programmer that has many requirements normal computer users
may not from their keyboard. Thus, I have many remappings and macros for my
Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.

I've setup this repository to share them and to keep my settings backed up. Here
you will find many text files performing specific tasks. The Advantage 2 does
not use these files. They are for reference and for building new layers. You
will also find files such as qwerty.txt, 1_qwerty.txt, etc... These files the
Advantage 2 does use directly.

Please visit https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/support/technical-support/manuals-drivers/
for use manuals on what the special filenames are.

invert-number-row.txt
---------------------

After analyzing the text of my source code repositories I found that I use the
special symbols on top of the numbers much more than the actual numbers. Thus,
why make those require a shift key to access? This file maps `1` to be `!` and the
inverse, `Shift+1` to be the actual `1`. It does this for all the numbers.

A close second beind this is invert-programming-keys.txt.

invert-programming-keys.txt
---------------------------------

As one who programs a good deal of JavaScript code, again in my analysis, I
found I use the cury braces much more than the square brackets. Thus, this
inverts the `[` and `]` keys just as invert-number-row.txt does.

qwerty.txt
----------

My personal base level mapping.

1_qwerty.txt
------------

My personal base level mapping plus my inverting keys. I use this when
programming.

colemak.txt
-----------

Based on the Qwerty base layer, this provides the Colemak layout.

norman.txt
